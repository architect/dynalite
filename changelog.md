# Dynalite changelog

---

## [4.0.0] 2023-tbd

Hello! After a bit of a hiatus, the [Architect team](https://github.com/architect/dynalite/issues/166) is pleased bring the first new Dynalite release in over two years!

### Added

- Added `--host` / `options.host` option for specifying a particular host
- Added `--verbose|-v` / `options.verbose`, `--debug|-d` / `options.debug` logging modes, and some additional logging
- Added `-h` help alias for CLI
- Added Typescript Types via JSDOC comments
- Enabled `port` and `host` options to be passed to Dynalite in `http` mode (instead of needing to be set in `dynalite.listen(port, host)`)


### Changed

- [Breaking change] Introduced minimum Node.js version of >= 18; fixes [#169](https://github.com/architect/dynalite/issues/169)
- [Breaking change] When using SSL mode, you must now supply your own `key`, `cert`, and `ca` (which isn't much of a breaking change, really, because Dynalite's certs were expired); fixes [#176](https://github.com/architect/dynalite/issues/176)
  - In CLI mode, pass them as file paths with flags (e.g. `--key /foo/key.pem --cert /foo/cert.pem --ca /foo/ca-cert.pem`)
  - As a module, you can pass them as strings or as file paths; when passing as file paths, make sure you include a boolean `useSSLFilePaths` option
- Changed license from MIT to Apache 2.0; see [#166](https://github.com/architect/dynalite/issues/166)
- Updated dependencies (which themselves dropped support for older versions of Node.js)
- Updated tests
- Added Architect Code of Conduct, new CI flow, etc.
