# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the Dynalite project's dependencies to use the latest versions and replace outdated packages with Node.js built-in alternatives where appropriate. **CRITICAL**: The current LevelDB ecosystem dependencies (levelup, memdown, subleveldown) are all DEPRECATED ⚠️ and superseded by the new abstract-level ecosystem. The primary focus is on migrating from the deprecated LevelDB packages to their modern successors and replacing Mocha with Node.js built-in test runner. The goal is to reduce the dependency footprint, improve security, and leverage modern Node.js capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Update Node.js Version

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest stable Node.js version so that I can benefit from performance improvements, security updates, and modern JavaScript features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the Node.js version THEN the engines field SHALL specify Node.js >=20 (latest LTS)
2. WHEN using modern Node.js THEN the code SHALL leverage built-in features where possible
3. WHEN updating Node.js version THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2: Replace Dependencies with Built-ins

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to reduce external dependencies by using Node.js built-ins so that I can minimize security vulnerabilities and reduce bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 'once' module is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with a simple wrapper function or removed entirely
2. WHEN the 'minimist' module is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with Node.js built-in `util.parseArgs()` (Node 18.3+)
3. WHEN replacing dependencies THEN all existing CLI functionality SHALL work identically
4. WHEN replacing dependencies THEN all callback patterns SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 3: Update Remaining Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies updated to their latest stable versions so that I can benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating dependencies THEN all production dependencies SHALL be updated to latest stable versions
2. WHEN updating dependencies THEN all development dependencies SHALL be updated to latest stable versions
3. WHEN updating LevelDB dependencies THEN compatibility with existing data formats SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN updating test dependencies THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN updating ESLint THEN the code style SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 4: Evaluate Async Library Usage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to assess whether the async library can be replaced with modern Promise/async-await patterns so that the code uses more modern JavaScript patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating async usage THEN a decision SHALL be made whether to keep or replace it
2. IF replacing async THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
3. IF keeping async THEN it SHALL be updated to the latest version
4. WHEN making changes THEN performance SHALL not be significantly degraded

### Requirement 5: Modernize LevelDB Ecosystem (CRITICAL - DEPRECATED PACKAGES)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the deprecated LevelDB dependencies with their modern successors so that I can maintain a supported codebase and benefit from performance improvements while ensuring data compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing levelup@5.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with level@10.x (levelup is DEPRECATED ⚠️)
2. WHEN replacing memdown@6.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with memory-level@3.x (memdown is DEPRECATED ⚠️)  
3. WHEN replacing subleveldown@6.0.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with abstract-level sublevel functionality (subleveldown is DEPRECATED ⚠️)
4. WHEN updating leveldown@6.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with classic-level (part of level@10.x ecosystem)
5. WHEN migrating to new LevelDB ecosystem THEN existing database files SHALL remain compatible
6. WHEN migrating to new LevelDB ecosystem THEN all database operations SHALL maintain identical behavior
7. WHEN migrating to new LevelDB ecosystem THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved
8. WHEN replacing deprecated packages THEN the migration SHALL follow Level community migration guide

### Requirement 6: Replace Mocha with Node.js Built-in Test Runner

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Node.js built-in test runner instead of Mocha so that I can reduce dependencies and use modern testing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing Mocha THEN Node.js built-in `node:test` module SHALL be used
2. WHEN replacing Mocha THEN all existing test cases SHALL be converted to Node.js test format
3. WHEN replacing Mocha THEN the `should` assertion library SHALL be replaced with Node.js built-in `node:assert`
4. WHEN replacing test framework THEN all test functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN replacing test framework THEN test coverage reporting SHALL be maintained
6. WHEN replacing test framework THEN npm test script SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 7: Update Build and Development Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated build and development tools so that I can use the latest features and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating ESLint THEN it SHALL be updated to the latest version
2. WHEN updating PEG.js THEN it SHALL be updated to the latest version or replaced with @peggyjs/peggy
3. WHEN updating tools THEN all existing scripts SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN updating tools THEN the build process SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 8: Maintain Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of Dynalite, I want all existing functionality to work after the dependency updates so that my applications continue to function without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all DynamoDB API operations SHALL work identically
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all CLI options SHALL work identically  
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all configuration options SHALL work identically
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the programmatic API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all tests SHALL pass without modification

### Requirement 9: Security and Performance

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the updated dependencies to improve security and performance so that the project is more robust and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN no known security vulnerabilities SHALL be introduced
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN startup time SHALL not be significantly increased
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN memory usage SHALL not be significantly increased
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN DynamoDB operation performance SHALL be maintained or improved
