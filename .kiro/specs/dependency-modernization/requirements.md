# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature upgrades the leveldown dependency to classic-level to maintain compatibility with the modern LevelDB ecosystem. The current leveldown@6.1.1 is an optional dependency that should be replaced with classic-level, which is the modern successor in the Level ecosystem. The goal is to ensure continued compatibility and support while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Upgrade LevelDB ecosystem dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade the LevelDB ecosystem dependencies to their modern successors so that I can use the current LevelDB ecosystem while maintaining all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading leveldown@6.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with classic-level@1.x as an explicit dependency
2. WHEN upgrading levelup@5.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with abstract-level functionality
3. WHEN upgrading memdown@6.1.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with memory-level@3.x
4. WHEN upgrading subleveldown@6.0.1 THEN it SHALL be replaced with abstract-level sublevel functionality
5. WHEN upgrading to modern LevelDB ecosystem THEN all existing database operations SHALL work identically
6. WHEN upgrading to modern LevelDB ecosystem THEN existing database files SHALL remain compatible
7. WHEN upgrading to modern LevelDB ecosystem THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved

### Requirement 2: Maintain Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of Dynalite, I want all existing functionality to work after the LevelDB ecosystem upgrade so that my applications continue to function without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LevelDB dependencies are upgraded THEN all DynamoDB API operations SHALL work identically
2. WHEN LevelDB dependencies are upgraded THEN all CLI options SHALL work identically  
3. WHEN LevelDB dependencies are upgraded THEN all configuration options SHALL work identically
4. WHEN LevelDB dependencies are upgraded THEN the programmatic API SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN LevelDB dependencies are upgraded THEN all tests SHALL pass without modification

### Requirement 3: Verify Integration

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want to ensure the modern LevelDB ecosystem integration works correctly so that the upgrade is successful and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modern LevelDB ecosystem is integrated THEN no known security vulnerabilities SHALL be introduced
2. WHEN modern LevelDB ecosystem is integrated THEN startup time SHALL not be significantly increased
3. WHEN modern LevelDB ecosystem is integrated THEN memory usage SHALL not be significantly increased
4. WHEN modern LevelDB ecosystem is integrated THEN database operation performance SHALL be maintained or improved
5. WHEN modern LevelDB ecosystem is integrated THEN all existing tests SHALL pass
